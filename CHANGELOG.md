This update supports Minecraft 1.21.2-1.21.5. While nothing changed from v1.12.2, MCC Island changed the minimum Minecraft version to 1.21, so that will be the minimum supported version starting with this release.

Sorry for the very late update, I had some technical issues which prevented me from working on the mod, but everything is fixed.
