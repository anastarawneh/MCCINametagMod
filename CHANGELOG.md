A few things:
- Fixed incompatibility with newer versions of Noxesium
- Fixed HITW and TGTTOS not working because I'm an idiot
- Fixed the health bar in Parkour Warrior Survivor being cut in half
- Removed the medal counter from the Parkour Warrior lobby nametag because that part was removed on the server
- Prepared for the eventual 1.21.3 update whenever Noxesium updates
