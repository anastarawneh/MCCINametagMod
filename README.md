This is a mod that displays your own nametag on MCC Island, exactly the way the server does it. This includes rank and team colors, achievement points and faction rank in lobbies, and the health bar in Sky Battle and Battle Box. 

**This mod supports Fabric 1.19.2, and requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).**

### To-Do:
- Display the actual rank in lobbies, currently only the name is colored.
- Support for other 1.19.x versions.
- Clean up my Discord to use for support.

### Known Issues:
- If you change your faction, the mod doesn't recognize your new faction until the next time you load Minecraft.

Please report any bugs or issues to the [GitHub repository issue tracker](https://github.com/anastarawneh/MCCINametagMod/issues).

This mod is not affiliated with MCC Island or Noxcrew.
